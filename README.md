### Comparative Analysis of BERT and IndoBERT

This project presents a sentiment analysis study on Indonesian social media content discussing career women.  
The research focuses on comparing the performance of **BERT** and **IndoBERT** models in understanding sentiment within the Indonesian language context.

The study explores how societal attitudes toward career women are reflected in online discourse and how language-specific models perform in capturing these sentiments.

## Overview

Public conversations around career women in Indonesia are shaped by cultural, social, and patriarchal norms. These discussions are often expressed informally on social media platforms, making sentiment analysis both challenging and meaningful.

This project applies transformer-based language models to analyze sentiment polarity and evaluate how well general-purpose versus language-adapted models perform on Indonesian text.

## Methodology

The dataset consists of Indonesian-language social media posts related to career women. Text preprocessing, tokenization, and labeling are followed by model training and evaluation using BERT and IndoBERT architectures.

Performance is assessed using standard classification metrics, enabling a structured comparison between the two models.

## Technology

The research is implemented using Python and modern NLP libraries. Transformer-based models are utilized through established deep learning frameworks, with experiments conducted in a reproducible notebook-based environment.

## Purpose

This project aims to demonstrate applied NLP research skills, model evaluation, and critical analysis of transformer architectures in a low-resource language setting. It also contributes insights into how sentiment mining can reflect social perceptions within Indonesian society.

## Future Work

Future directions include expanding the dataset, exploring aspect-based sentiment analysis, and evaluating newer transformer variants tailored for Indonesian or multilingual contexts.
